# QEnergy - Energetic Analysis of Emerging Quantum Communication Protocols

QEnergy is project that aims at analyze the energetic cost of quantum communication protocols, in particular the ones that are being deployed on quantum communication infrastructures, such as Quantum Key Distribution.

This is of particular interest in a World with finite resources, and a field where choices are yet to be made before a wider deployment. Hence, the results of such study can influence future deployment choices.
